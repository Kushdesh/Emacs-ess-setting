# Emacs-ess-setting
My settings of emacs with ess by Vincent Goulet for windows.
This has been used on windows 10

# Additional works
- Change the folder name .i.e. Emacs-ess-setting to '.emacs.d'
- The `.emacs` file should have been removed 
- install Inconsolata font. You can download it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata)
- Change set-register lines in personal.el with appropriate file/folder address
- Check if ess-insert-assign in my_R.el is working. i.e. pressing ';' in a R code put ' <- '. If not working try ess-insert-S-assign instead
- In my_python.el correct virtual environment paths. e.g. (pyvenv-activate "C:\Users\Kushdesh\Miniconda3")
- run M-x elpy-config to see what are missing to install. Not all are required to install.
- Check in `*Message*` for any error and rectify them.
